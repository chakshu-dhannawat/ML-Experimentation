# ML-Experimentation
Experimentation with the recent advancements in Machine Learning. <br>
This repositories contains the experimentation that I will perform on the recent advancements in AI. Mostly related to the recent research papers released in the community, and the machine learning models that have become quite popular.

Recently, understood that model explainability plays a vital role in building trust and confidence with the users. Thus, experimented with the technique 'GradCAM' which highlights (sort of a heatmap over the image) the areas over which our model gives more importance to classsify the image.
